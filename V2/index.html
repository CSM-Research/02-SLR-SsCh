      <p>
        <b>Context:</b>Sustainability is a topic that started to be discussed in the area of ecology in the 1980s. This topic proved to be multidisciplinary and other areas realized the need to produce sustainable products. Among these areas, Software Engineering has also realized that it is necessary to include sustainability as a quality requirement. The currently published literature has several secondary studies that bring together several characteristics of sustainable software, however, these initiatives do not have a summary where it is possible to fully understand the characteristics of sustainable software.<br>
        <b>Objective:</b>in this paper we aim to understand what are the characteristics of sustainable software and what initiatives are available in the literature to support the process of building sustainable software.<br>
        <b>Method:</b>to achieve this goal we conducted a tertiary study. Our study followed a defined process and a search protocol. The analysis considers the different studies selected for evidence in the literature of characteristics of sustainable software.<br>
        <b>Results:</b>the main contributions of this work include 17 different definitions for sustainable software; 5 resources consumed to build software; 61 factors that influence the success or failure of sustainable software production; 277 different guidelines and 117 approaches (eg processes, methods, tools, frameworks) that support the construction of sustainable software. <br>
        <b>Conclusion:</b>the search for sustainability in the construction of software has received a lot of attention in recent years. The secondary studies conducted proposed several advances to the state of the art, and several initiatives have already been applied and evaluated.<br>
